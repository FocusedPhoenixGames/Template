[b][u]How to use the Random Stream Component[/u][/b]
Instantiate the Random Stream Component as the child of a scene you want. From there you add more elements to the Stream Array and drop in the audio files you'd like to play.
After that you can connect to it through code. A common use case would be to connect to a [[Hurtbox Component]]'s hit signal and then playing having the Random Stream Component play_random()
