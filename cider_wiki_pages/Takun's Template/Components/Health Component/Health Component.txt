[b][u]Signals[/u][/b]
	The Health Component has two signals, health_changed and died. You can connect to these signals to do things like update health displays, or update an enemy kill counter, or whatever else you need.
	
	
[b][u]Methods[/u][/b]
	The Health Component has two methods that you should use: damage() and heal(). When used with the [[Hurtbox Component]] it will automatically call the damage() function and pass through the damage from any [[Hitbox Component]] that's on the same collision layer and mask.
