The Hitbox Component is used for anything that needs to deal damage. You can adjust the damage amount in the Inspector.

[b][u]How to use the Hitbox Component[/u][/b]
Instantiate the Hitbox Component in the scene. From there, simply adjust the damage amount, give it a child node of CollisionShape2D, and assign the correct Collision Layers and Masks that you want the Hitbox Component to interact with.

[b]NOTE: [/b]
You can assign multiple collision shapes to the Hitbox and have them be Enabled/ Disabled through code or an Animation Player to manage different attacks, but the they will all have the same damage amount unless changed through code.
