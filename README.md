# Template

Quick Summary
This template project is for Godot 4.2.1 and helps cut out some of the more tedius things like making basic UI menus, button remaps, etc. It also comes with some generic components to speed up the game design process and help get prototypes off the ground faster. 

My coding style
As of right now, everything is set up in my style of coding which is slightly unconventional.
- variables are in cammelCase instead of snake_case
- @onready vars are placed above vars
I find these changes easer to read/ skim through at a glance, but feel free to change it how you like to match the rest of your project.

This template contains:
- Title Screen Menu
- Options Screen Menu
- Controls Screen Menu
- Credits Screen
- Sound Button (plays random UI sounds when clicked)
- Health Component
- Hitbox Component
- Hurtbox Component
- Random Stream Component (plays random sfx sounds)
- Music Player
